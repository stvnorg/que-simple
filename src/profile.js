  about_me: "My name is Steven Stevanus, I'm from Indonesia, and currently I'm working and live in Mexico. A father, husband and a follower of Jesus Christ the Son of G-D. My career started as a Technical support, System Administrator, and now as an SRE/DevOps. Never stop learning, always want to try out something new. I see technology as a tool and not as the end goal. The tool that enabled us to achieve greater purpose, to create solutions for many challenges, and not just in terms of technological challenges but it can be economy, science, etc. To help people, mentoring, training and educate people so they can have a better life, able to think for themself, critical with a sense of self introspective.",
